### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I created this GitHub page in order to show that I understand how coding works.

Actually, I am student of economic university with a major in Innovation Management, but I also studied Engineering Management in european (Hungary) university during 2021/22 academic year.

In Europe I learned the following skills that are connected with IT:
- Java,
- OOP in C#,
- Computer Science,
- IT Project Management.

Yeah, currently I am looking for job opportunities as Assistant Project Manager or Java/C# Developer.
