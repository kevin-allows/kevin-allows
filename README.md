### Hi there 👋

I created this GitHub page in order to show that I understand how coding works by showing the programmes that I developed.

👨🏻‍🎓 Actually, I am student of economic university with a major in Innovation Management, but I also studied Engineering Management in european (Hungary) university during 2021/22 academic year.

👨🏼‍💻 In Europe I learned the following skills that are connected with IT:
- Java,
- OOP in C#,
- Computer Science,
- IT Project Management.

Yeah, currently I am looking for job opportunities as Assistant/Intern Project Manager or Java/C# Junior Developer.
